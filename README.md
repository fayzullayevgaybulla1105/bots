# About: Telegram bot

- Typescript
- MongoDB


If you haven’t written TypeScript before, don’t be afraid of it. This is almost the same as JavaScript. But it gives more useful information before something goes wrong at work.

When I started diving into TypeScript, I learned a lot about JavaScript itself.

# Installation
-  npm setup

# Launch the bot
## Local development
Write to @BotFather on Telegram and create your bot. You will receive a token that looks like this : 123:abc. Create a file bot-token.txtand paste it there.
